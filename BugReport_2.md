##2nd Bug Report

#Creating our own map with the bonus of it being Valentines Day themes.
This bug was not on the part of the program or my computer, but instead myself - for not dedicating enough time to finish this part of the task list.

#Method to reproduce:
Don't give yourself enough time to finish.

#Attempt to debug:
I'm sorry Shawn I did not finish this part of the task list.
